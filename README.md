Design choice
This is a minimalistic aesthetic design with a colored theme for different sections that also helped in seperating content.
For the responsiveness of the design, @media query and flexbox is mostly used
It also has interactive features like anchor tags that takes you to different sections of the web page


What I found difficult
- achieving full responsiveness of the page, i realised that if i am using media queries i am meant to be defining almost all possisble points for screen sizes. That is at 480px, 768px and even larger pixels
- overlapping of elements, I later on realised that i could be using z-index so that the element i want to be seen on top is visible
- navigating through css properties in the first place. 
- Realisation that the order in which the HTML is written affects the order in which the elements are shown in the web page


What I'm most proud of
- the fact that if i understand how i want my elements to look like, i can now write most of the css on my own without having to refer to google and tutorial websites now and then
- that i am now even more confident that i can take on another project without hesitation because i have learnt so much throughout building this website even though there is still much more to learn
